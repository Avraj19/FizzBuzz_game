# FizzBuzz Game!
## Program FizzBuzz game
### Learning Objective:
 - Use functions to make you code DRY
 - Try using while loop instead a while loop
 
### Task
Prompt the user for input, the input should limit how long the game runs.
Every time the number is divisible by 3 say Fizz, if divisible by 5 Buzz and 
if divisible by both FizzBuzz.
 
Following these rules:

- Multiple of 3 are Fizz
- Multiple of 5 are Buzz
- Multiples of 3 and 5 are FizzBuzz
- As a user I should be ask for a number
- So that I can play the game with my input
- As a player, I should see the game counting up to my number and
substituting the multiples of 3 and 5 with the appropriate values,
So that I can see if it is working
### EXTRA TASK!
As a player, I should be able to exit the game using a key word,
so that I can stop playing
